//! Extended RaBitQ encoder: multi-bit document codes (no centroids).
//!
//! The extended version of [`rabitq`](crate::encoders::rabitq): documents are quantized to a
//! uniform `total_bits ∈ {2, 4, 8}` bits per component — 1 sign bit plus
//! `ex_bits = total_bits − 1` magnitude bits — following RaBitQ-Library's extended scheme
//! (*Practical and Asymptotically Optimal Quantization of High-Dimensional Vectors*, Gao et al.).
//! `total_bits = 1` (the plain sign code, `ex_bits = 0`) is **not** handled here and is rejected by
//! [`train`](RabitqExtQuantizer::train): it degenerates to and scores identically to
//! [`RabitqQuantizer`](crate::encoders::rabitq::RabitqQuantizer), so use that 1-bit encoder for it.
//! **The query is never quantized here** — there is no `query_bits` dial (see [`Scoring`](self)).
//!
//! This file intentionally duplicates the private helpers of `rabitq.rs` (kernels, rescale-factor
//! search, query quantization) so the two implementations stay independent; they may be merged
//! later. The preprocessing is identical: residual `r = P·(x − mean)` with per-component means and
//! a seeded [`FhtKacRotator`](crate::FhtKacRotator) (disable via [`RabitqExtConfig::rotate`]).
//!
//! ## Document code
//!
//! With `o_abs_i = |r_i|/‖r‖` and `t` from the exact rescale-factor search
//! (`best_rescale_factor`), each component gets a magnitude code
//! `e_i = min(⌊t·o_abs_i⌋, 2^ex_bits − 1)` and the total code
//!
//! ```text
//! u_i = e_i | (1 << ex_bits)      if r_i ≥ 0        # sign bit on top
//! u_i = (!e_i) & (2^ex_bits − 1)  if r_i < 0        # complement-coded magnitude
//! ```
//!
//! With `cb = −(2^ex_bits − 0.5)` the shifted code is **antisymmetric**:
//! `u_i + cb = sign(r_i)·(e_i + 0.5)`, so `⟨r, u + cb⟩ = ‖r‖·ipnorm` with
//! `ipnorm = Σ (e_i + 0.5)·o_abs_i > 0` — the quantized direction always points with the residual.
//!
//! ## Scoring
//!
//! The unbiased projection estimator (any scaling of the quantized direction cancels):
//!
//! ```text
//! ⟨r, q_r⟩ ≈ (‖r‖² / ⟨r, u + cb⟩)·⟨u + cb, q_r⟩ = s_ext·⟨u + cb, q_r⟩,   s_ext = ‖r‖/ipnorm
//! ```
//!
//! against the **unquantized** rotated query `q_r`, which splits into one dot product over the
//! stored code and a per-query constant:
//!
//! ```text
//! raw  = ⟨u, q_r⟩ + cb·Σq_r          # = ⟨u + cb, q_r⟩; the second term is `q_const`
//! term = s_ext · raw                  # ≈ ⟨r, q_r⟩
//! ```
//!
//! `⟨u, q_r⟩` is `doc_code_ip_exact`: widen each `total_bits`-wide code field to f32 and FMA it
//! against the query. `term` then feeds the same metric combine as the 1-bit encoder
//! ([`RabitqSupportedDistance::from_terms`]): `f_add + g_add − 2·term` for squared Euclidean,
//! `⟨mean, q⟩ + term` for inner product.
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! Each document is `total_bits · d/64` code words in **component-major** layout — each `u_i`
//! occupies one aligned `total_bits`-wide field, and a 16-byte block holds `8/total_bits`
//! sub-groups of 16 consecutive components (see `byte_slot`) — plus one metadata word packing the
//! two scan-ready floats
//! `[f_add = ‖r‖² | s_ext = ‖r‖/ipnorm]`, so the per-candidate scan does no divide. Only dimensions
//! that are a multiple of 64 are supported (no bit-padding).
//!
//! ## How this differs from RaBitQ-Library
//!
//! The code this encoder produces is compatible in spirit with RaBitQ-Library but differs in
//! storage layout and in which widths are supported. Four deliberate divergences:
//!
//! 1. **One slab and one pass, against their two.** RaBitQ-Library keeps the sign bit in a `bin`
//!    slab separate from the `ex` magnitude slab, so `split_single_fulldist` scores each candidate
//!    with two kernels over two allocations, traversing the query twice. That layout serves their
//!    HNSW early-exit lower bound, which an exhaustive scan never consults. Storing all
//!    `total_bits` together reads each query element exactly once.
//! 2. **Byte-aligned widths only.** `{2,4,8}` unpack with one shift and mask on whole 8-bit lanes.
//!    Supporting every width in `1..=9`, as they do, forces cross-byte reassembly — their 7-bit
//!    kernel spends roughly 25 SSE-width integer ops per 64 components rebuilding fields before any
//!    arithmetic.
//! 3. **Four independent accumulator chains** (`doc_code_ip_exact`). Both reference kernels
//!    accumulate into a single register, so their chain is bound by FMA latency rather than
//!    throughput. GCC obtains the split for free from `-ffast-math`; rustc will not reassociate f32
//!    addition, so it is written out here.
//! 4. **The width is resolved once per query, not per candidate.** Their scan calls the ex-code
//!    kernel through a function pointer, which cannot be inlined. A `match` on `total_bits` selects
//!    a monomorphized kernel with literal loop bounds and shift amounts.
//!
//! The widths, the layout and the metadata packing are therefore load-bearing performance
//! decisions rather than incidental ones; see the kernel notes on `doc_code_ip_exact` and
//! `part_ip_direct` before changing any of them.
